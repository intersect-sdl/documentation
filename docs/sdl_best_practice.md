## FAIR Principles

The FAIR principles aim to make data:

| FAIR Principle | Meaning |
| Findable  | Data should be easy to locate with metadata and identifiers | 
| Accessible  | Data and metadata should be retrievable by humans and machines | 
| Interoperable  | Data should use standardized vocabularies and formats | 
| Reusable  | Data should be richly described and licensed for reuse | 

Adopted widely in open science and by funders (e.g., EU Horizon, NIH).

## CARE Principles (for Indigenous Data Governance)

The CARE principles emphasize ethical data stewardship, especially for Indigenous communities:

| CARE Principle | Meaning |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Collective Benefit | Data should enhance community wellbeing |
| Authority to Control | Communities should govern their own data |
| Responsibility | Researchers should engage respectfully and with accountability |
| Ethics | Use of data must uphold the rights and values of source communities |

Complements FAIR by addressing power, ownership, and equity in data governance.
