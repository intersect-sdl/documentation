title: SDL User Guide
---

Welcome to the Scientific Data Layer (SDL) platform! This guide helps researchers, data curators, content authors, and collaborators navigate and use SDL effectively for managing scientific data and workflows.

SDL provides a unified interface for organizing research data using semantic web technologies, enabling FAIR data principles, collaborative workspaces, and rich metadata management across scientific domains.

## Getting Started

### Accessing SDL

SDL platforms are typically hosted by research institutions and provide web-based access to scientific data management tools. Contact your system administrator for:

- **Login credentials** and workspace access
- **Platform URL** and connection details
- **Initial workspace** assignment and permissions

### First Login

Upon logging in, you'll see:

- **Workspace dashboard** - Your assigned projects and collaborative spaces
- **Navigation sidebar** - Quick access to data collections, workflows, and tools
- **Content browser** - Semantic organization of datasets, documents, and resources
- **Activity feed** - Recent changes and collaborative updates

## Core Concepts

### Workspaces

Workspaces are collaborative environments where research teams organize projects, data, and workflows:

- **Project Workspaces** - Dedicated spaces for research initiatives
- **Data Collections** - Organized datasets with semantic metadata
- **Collaborative Editing** - Real-time content creation and annotation
- **Access Control** - Role-based permissions for team members

### Semantic Content

SDL organizes information using semantic web standards, providing:

- **Typed Content Blocks** - Structured data with defined meanings
- **Ontology Integration** - Standard vocabularies for scientific domains
- **Linked Data** - Connections between related concepts and datasets
- **Provenance Tracking** - Complete history of data creation and modification

### FAIR Principles

SDL implements FAIR data practices:

- **Findable** - Rich metadata and semantic search capabilities
- **Accessible** - Standardized interfaces and data formats
- **Interoperable** - RDF standards and ontology alignment
- **Reusable** - Clear licensing and comprehensive documentation

## Working with Data

### Creating Content

#### Data Upload and Import

1. **Navigate to workspace** - Select your target project workspace
2. **Choose content type** - Select from available semantic templates
3. **Upload files** - Drag and drop or browse for data files
4. **Add metadata** - Complete required fields using guided forms
5. **Semantic annotation** - Tag content with domain-specific terms

#### Structured Content Creation

SDL provides templates for common scientific content types:

- **Experimental Procedures** - Step-by-step protocol documentation
- **Dataset Descriptions** - Comprehensive metadata for research data
- **Analytical Results** - Structured reporting of measurements and observations
- **Literature References** - Bibliographic information with semantic links

### Content Organization

#### Hierarchical Structure

Organize content using semantic relationships:

- **Collections** - Group related datasets and documents
- **Categories** - Domain-specific classification schemes
- **Tags and Keywords** - Flexible labeling system
- **Relationships** - Explicit connections between resources

#### Search and Discovery

Find content using multiple approaches:

- **Semantic Search** - Query using domain terminology and concepts
- **Faceted Browsing** - Filter by content type, date, author, or domain
- **Graph Navigation** - Explore connections between related resources
- **Full-text Search** - Traditional keyword-based content discovery

### Data Annotation

#### Metadata Management

Enhance data discoverability through rich metadata:

- **Descriptive Metadata** - Title, abstract, keywords, and descriptions
- **Administrative Metadata** - Creation date, author, permissions, and version
- **Structural Metadata** - File formats, relationships, and organization
- **Technical Metadata** - Instrument settings, software versions, and protocols

#### Ontology Integration

SDL leverages standard vocabularies:

- **Domain Ontologies** - Specialized terms for chemistry, materials science, etc.
- **Upper Ontologies** - General concepts like time, space, and causation
- **Provenance Models** - Track data creation, modification, and analysis workflows
- **Measurement Standards** - Units, quantities, and observational metadata

## Collaboration Features

### Team Workspaces

Collaborate effectively with research partners:

- **Shared Collections** - Common access to project datasets
- **Role-based Permissions** - Control editing and viewing rights
- **Activity Notifications** - Stay informed about workspace changes
- **Version Control** - Track content evolution and maintain history

### Content Editing

Work together on research documentation:

- **Collaborative Editing** - Multiple users editing content simultaneously
- **Comment and Review** - Provide feedback and suggestions on content
- **Approval Workflows** - Structured review and publication processes
- **Change Tracking** - Comprehensive audit trail of modifications

### Communication Tools

Stay connected with team members:

- **Workspace Chat** - Discuss project details and coordinate activities
- **Annotation Comments** - Context-specific discussions on data and content
- **Activity Streams** - Follow updates and changes across workspaces
- **Notification Settings** - Customize alerts for relevant events

## Platform-Specific Features
