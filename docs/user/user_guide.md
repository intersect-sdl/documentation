Welcome to the Scientific Data Layer (SDL) platform — a flexible, semantic ecosystem designed to support scientific data creation, exploration, and management through linked data principles.

## Getting Started

SDL is accessed via your web browser. Once you log in, you'll be directed to your default workspace.

### Requirements
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Web access to your SDL instance

### Logging In
You’ll receive credentials from your institution or administrator. Use these to log in via the `/login` page.

---

## Understanding Workspaces

Workspaces are your organizational units within SDL. Each workspace:
- Contains semantic documents, datasets, and workflows
- Has its own permissions and visibility
- Can be shared among teams or collaborators

You can switch between workspaces using the workspace selector in the top-left corner of the UI.

---

## Navigating the Interface

SDL offers a clean, block-based interface. Key UI elements include:
- **Sidebar**: Workspace navigation, search, recent items
- **Main View**: Displays pages, datasets, or visualizations
- **Toolbar**: Actions like add block, save, export, etc.

Keyboard shortcuts and drag-and-drop features are available for power users.

---

## Creating and Managing Content

You can create new documents, datasets, or visual workflows using the "+ New" button.

Each page is composed of semantic blocks:
- **Text blocks** with annotations
- **Data blocks** that connect to RDF resources
- **Visualization blocks** (e.g., graphs, charts)

All content is stored with semantic annotations and version history.

---

## Semantic Editing

SDL allows inline semantic annotation and RDF-backed editing.

You can:
- Link terms to ontologies (e.g., SSN, DCAT)
- Create typed resources directly from the editor
- Autocomplete vocabulary terms

Use the right-click menu or toolbar to apply semantic types.

---

## Searching and Filtering Data

Use the global search bar or workspace-specific filters to:
- Find pages, resources, datasets, or types
- Filter by date, author, class, or tags
- Preview RDF triples inline before opening items

Advanced SPARQL queries are supported for power users.

---

## Importing and Exporting

You can import/export content in various formats:
- **Import**: JSON-LD, Turtle, CSV
- **Export**: JSON-LD, Turtle, PDF, HTML

Data is validated during import and matched to known ontologies.

---

## User Preferences and Settings

From the settings menu (top-right avatar):
- Change theme (light/dark)
- Manage notification preferences
- Update profile info
- Manage API tokens
