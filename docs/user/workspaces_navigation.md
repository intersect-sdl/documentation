> **Disclaimer:** Many of the features described in this guide are still in planning or active development. Some functionality may not yet be available in your instance.

Workspaces in the Scientific Data Layer (SDL) are designed to provide structure, separation, and collaboration around scientific content and data.

This guide explains how workspaces function and how to navigate SDL efficiently.

## What is a Workspace?

A workspace is a dedicated environment for organizing and managing related content. Think of it like a virtual lab or project folder:

- **Contextual Scope**: Each workspace defines a context for RDF data, users, and content.
- **Access Control**: Workspaces have their own role-based permissions.
- **Semantic Separation**: RDF resources are scoped per workspace using named graphs.

You can use workspaces to manage:
- Research projects
- Collaborative teams
- Organizational units (e.g., labs, departments)
- Data curation efforts

## Accessing Workspaces

When you log in, you'll be placed in your default workspace. To switch or explore:

1. Click the **workspace switcher** in the top-left corner.
2. A dropdown shows available workspaces and recent ones.
3. Select a workspace to switch contexts.
4. Optional: Use the search bar to find specific workspace names.

## Navigating the Workspace UI

Each workspace has a consistent layout:

- **Sidebar**: Lists navigation links, custom views, tags, and recent items.
- **Main View**: Displays selected pages, datasets, or dashboards.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Show your current path and allow backtracking.
- **Search Bar**: Filters results within the current workspace.

Keyboard shortcuts and navigation aids enhance your speed:
- `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K`) to open the quick switcher
- Arrow keys to navigate lists
- Escape to close popovers or dialogs

## Managing Workspaces

Users with appropriate permissions can:
- **Create** new workspaces (from the switcher menu)
- **Rename** and describe workspaces
- **Invite** collaborators with specific roles (e.g., Viewer, Editor, Admin)
- **Configure** settings like:
  - Default ontologies
  - Namespace prefix mapping
  - Custom dashboards or home pages

## Tips for Organizing Your Work

- **Create separate workspaces** for major projects to avoid clutter.
- Use **semantic tags** to classify content.
- Favor **linked resources** over duplication.
- Use **custom views** to highlight important resources or workflows.

## Troubleshooting Navigation

If you can’t find something:
- Use the global or workspace search
- Check your filters or tags
- Ensure you’re in the correct workspace
- Contact an admin to confirm access permissions

Efficient navigation and workspace organization will significantly improve your experience with SDL. Each workspace is a semantic microcosm — a place where knowledge lives, grows, and connects.
