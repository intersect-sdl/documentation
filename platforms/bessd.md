The **BESSD platform** supports plant science and environmental research, integrating multiple subsystems:

- **APPL** for plant phenotyping.
- **SOILCOSM** for soil ecosystem studies.
- **VOC** for plant volatile monitoring.

## Key Features
- Imaging, environmental monitoring, and gas exchange analysis.
- Modular experiments tracked with precise deployment metadata.
- Integration with ontologies for plants, soils, and chemical properties.

## Data & Provenance
- All systems and sensors are linked through :rdfterm[ssn:Deployment].
- Observations include plant traits, VOC emissions, and soil dynamics.
- Each dataset includes :rdfterm[prov:Activity] traces and citations to methods.

## FAIR Compliance
- Semantic annotations for genotypes, treatments, and conditions.
- DOIs or URIs assigned to datasets and workflows.
- Interoperable metadata modeled with DCAT and SSN.
