The Selfdriven Experiments for Science/Interconnected Science Ecosystem (INTERSECT) Open Architecture enables science breakthroughs using intelligent networked systems, instruments and facilities with autonomous experiments, “self-driving” laboratories, smart manufacturing and artificial intelligence (AI) driven design, discovery and evaluation. It creates an open federated architecture for the laboratory of the future using a novel approach, consisting of (1) science use case design patterns, (2) a system of systems architecture, and (3) a microservice architecture.},

	abstract = {CyVerse, the largest publicly-funded open-source research cyberinfrastructure for life sciences, has played a crucial role in advancing data-driven research since the 2010s. As the technology landscape evolved with the emergence of cloud computing platforms, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) applications, CyVerse has enabled access by providing interfaces, Software as a Service (SaaS), and cloud-native Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to leverage new technologies. CyVerse services enable researchers to integrate institutional and private computational resources, custom software, perform analyses, and publish data in accordance with open science principles. Over the past 13 years, CyVerse has registered more than 124,000 verified accounts from 160 countries and was used for over 1,600 peer-reviewed publications. Since 2011, 45,000 students and researchers have been trained to use CyVerse. The platform has been replicated and deployed in three countries outside the US, with additional private deployments on commercial clouds for US government agencies and multinational corporations. In this manuscript, we present a strategic blueprint for creating and managing SaaS cyberinfrastructure and IaC as free and open-source software.},

	abstract = {Technological advances are creating exciting new opportunities that have the potential to move HPC well beyond traditional computational workloads. In this paper we focus on the potential for HPC to be instrumental in responding to disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, extreme flooding, earthquakes, tsunamis, winter weather conditions, and accidents. Driven by the VESTEC EU funded H2020 project, our research looks to prove HPC as a tool not only capable of simulating disasters once they have happened, but also one which is able to operate in a responsive mode, supporting disaster response teams making urgent decisions in real-time. Whilst this has the potential to revolutionise disaster response, it requires the ability to drive HPC interactively, both from the user's perspective and also based upon the arrival of data. As such interactivity is a critical component in enabling HPC to be exploited in the role of supporting disaster response teams so that urgent decision makers can make the correct decision first time, every time.},

	abstract = {The rapid evolution of remote work has redefined traditional team structures, with asynchronous collaboration becoming a cornerstone of modern project delivery. However, productivity in distributed teams remains constrained by fragmented workflows, communication lags, and uneven cognitive demands. This paper explores a comprehensive framework for enhancing productivity in asynchronous remote teams by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented workflow orchestration and cognitive load balancing mechanisms. Drawing on empirical models and theoretical constructs from over 60 peer-reviewed studies—this study integrates natural language processing (NLP), task automation, and adaptive workload distribution into an AI-driven architecture. The framework enables dynamic prioritization of tasks based on team member capacity, context-aware notifications, and performance feedback loops. Key findings suggest that AI-supported cognitive orchestration significantly reduces task-switching costs and mitigates burnout risks, especially in multi-time-zone environments. The study also highlights how AI can bridge equity gaps by aligning human-centered design principles with intelligent scheduling and resource allocation. This research advances the discourse on remote workforce optimization by offering policy-relevant insights and scalable models for enterprise integration.},

This study investigates the relationship between AI tool usage and critical thinking skills, focusing on cognitive offloading as a mediating factor. Utilising a mixed-method approach, we conducted surveys and in-depth interviews with 666 participants across diverse age groups and educational backgrounds. Quantitative data were analysed using ANOVA and correlation analysis, while qualitative insights were obtained through thematic analysis of interview transcripts. The findings revealed a significant negative correlation between frequent AI tool usage and critical thinking abilities, mediated by increased cognitive offloading. Younger participants exhibited higher dependence on AI tools and lower critical thinking scores compared to older participants. Furthermore, higher educational attainment was associated with better critical thinking skills, regardless of AI usage. These results highlight the potential cognitive costs of AI tool reliance, emphasising the need for educational strategies that promote critical engagement with AI technologies. This study contributes to the growing discourse on AI’s cognitive implications, offering practical recommendations for mitigating its adverse effects on critical thinking. The findings underscore the importance of fostering critical thinking in an AI-driven world, making this research essential reading for educators, policymakers, and technologists.},

            There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
