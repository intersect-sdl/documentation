The Scientific Data Layer (SDL) provides a flexible and extensible ecosystem for managing scientific data using linked data principles, semantic web technologies, and modular microservices. This documentation is your guide to understanding, using, and extending SDL as a platform for FAIR data and collaborative research.

## Overview

SDL helps

* Organize data and metadata semantically using RDF and standard ontologies
* Track provenance, workflows, and content structure
* Enable collaborative editing within workspaces
* Deploy modular services for cataloging, storage, and content management
* Build reusable and dynamic UIs with semantic awareness

Whether you're a researcher, data curator, developer, or administrator, this documentation provides targeted guidance for your role.

## User Documentation
