The Scientific Data Layer (SDL) enables rich documentation, cataloging, and provenance tracking of scientific data generated by experimental platforms. Each platform is modeled using ontologies such as SSN/SOSA, DCAT, and PROV-O, supporting FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

## What is a Platform?

A platform in SDL represents an organized set of systems, instruments, and procedures used to generate scientific data. Each platform is:

* Described using semantic models aligned with W3C standards.
* Connected to datasets and observations through SSN-compliant deployments.
* Documented in a Linked Data Platform (LDP) for integration, querying, and discovery.

## Why Platforms Matter

By documenting platforms in a semantically rich way, SDL:

* Makes data and metadata FAIR from the start.
* Captures experimental context and instrument configurations.
* Enables reproducibility through machine-readable provenance.

## Available Platforms

* [[acl|ACL]]: Automated Chemistry Lab
* [[bessd|BESSD]]: Biological and Environmental Systems Science Directorate

Each platform includes:

*A semantic definition of systems and sensors.
*Descriptions of workflows and data products.
*Integration with DCAT catalogs and PROV traces.
