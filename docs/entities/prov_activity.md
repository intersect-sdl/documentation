The :rdfterm[prov:Activity] class describes actions or processes that occur over time and may use or generate entities. In SDL, :rdfterm[prov:Activity] is used to model sampling events, processing steps, analysis workflows, and other time-based operations that contribute to scientific data generation.

---

## Definition

**URI**: `http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Activity`

> A :rdfterm[prov:Activity] is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities. It may use entities and generate new ones.

---

## Usage in SDL

In SDL, :rdfterm[prov:Activity] is used to:

* Represent events like sampling, data acquisition, processing, or transformation
* Track the start and end time of operations
* Associate activities with responsible agents and input/output entities
* Provide full provenance chains for scientific workflows

Activities may be executed by software agents, technicians, or sensors, and may result in new :rdfterm[prov:Entity] instances.

## Composition

An activity is always bounded by time and may:

* Use one or more :rdfterm[prov:Entity] instances as input
* Generate one or more :rdfterm[prov:Entity] instances as output
* Be carried out by one or more :rdfterm[prov:Agent] actors

```turtle
ex:sampling1 a prov:Activity ;
  prov:used ex:locationPlan ;
  prov:wasAssociatedWith ex:agent2 ;
  prov:startedAtTime "2023-06-01T09:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
  prov:endedAtTime "2023-06-01T11:30:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
```

---

## Example — Data Generation Activity

```turtle
ex:activity3 a prov:Activity ;
  prov:used ex:sample1 ;
  prov:generated ex:observation1 ;
  prov:wasAssociatedWith ex:agentInstrument1 ;
  prov:startedAtTime "2024-02-15T14:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .

ex:observation1 a sosa:Observation , prov:Entity ;
  sosa:hasResult ex:resultValue .
```

## Related Classes

* :rdfterm[prov:Entity] — data created or used by the activity
* :rdfterm[prov:Agent] — performer or responsible party
* :rdfterm[sosa:Observation] — often the output of a scientific activity
